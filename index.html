        <h2>Food</h2>
        <p>Food facts span a wide range, from surprising origins to nutritional insights. Honey never spoils, while some cheeses
        contain wood pulp. 
        Apples are related to pears and quinces within the rose family.
         Bananas are botanically classified as
        berries, unlike strawberries.
         Carrots were originally purple, and the orange variety was bred for a specific Dutch royal
        family. Ketchup was once used as medicine.
        Here's a more detailed breakdown:
        Unexpected Origins and Classifications:
        Honey: Honey's ability to never spoil is due to its high sugar content and low water activity, preventing microbial
        growth.

        Legumes: Peanuts, despite their name, are legumes, not nuts.

        Berries: Bananas are botanically classified as berries, while strawberries are not.

        Carrots: The familiar orange carrot is a result of selective breeding, with purple, yellow, and white varieties existing
        historically.</p>

        <h2>Animals</h2>
        <p>Animals are multicellular, eukaryotic organisms comprising the biological kingdom Animalia. With few exceptions, animals
        consume organic material, breathe oxygen, have myocytes and are able to move, can reproduce sexually, and grow from a
        hollow sphere of cells, the blastula, during embryonic development.</p>
